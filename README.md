# eqalert.ru [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geophystech/eqalert.ru.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geophystech/eqalert.ru) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/geophystech/eqalert.ru/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/geophystech/eqalert.ru/)

Eqalert.ru â€“ the real-time information resource about earthquakes, seismic impacts and hazards

## v3 (SSR version)

This README is deprecated. Please check `./nuxt2/README.md`.

There is a new application written using `Nuxt2` with `Server-Side Rendering (SSR)` to make SEO better for _Google_ and _Yandex_ robots

---

## Used technologies

This is a Single Page Application built with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
Data is received from an API host using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library.

More about used technologies you can get from the `packages.json` file.

## Preparing application

```bash
# Clone application from GitHub
git clone git@github.com:geophystech/eqalert.ru.git

cd eqalert.ru

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```


## Development mode

To run application in development mode, just run:

``` bash
yarn dev
```

The application will be compiled and run.
It will be available at http://localhost:8080

By default the application uses hot-reload mode which means any changes will be picked up and all open pages will be reloaded automatically.
Exception is static markdown pages located in `static/markdown` directory.

If you changem them, you should update your browser pages manually (`F5`).

## Run tests

The application has a few tests. Not very good coverage yet, but still.

To run tests, just run:

```
# Unit tests
npm run unit

# E2E tests
npm run e2e

# Or run all tests
npm test
```

## Build application

To run application in staging or production areas, it should be compiled first:

```
NODE_ENV=production yarn build
```

The compiled application will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
You can deploy it to your target (staging, production, etc) using any tools you like.

Example of deploying the application manually to a staging host:

```bash
rsync -avzr --delete -e ssh dist/ USERNAME@HOSTNAME:/opt/eqalert-frontend-test
```

## Run docker container with prebuild application

```bash
docker run -p 8888:80 --rm --env API_URI=https://api-test.geophystech.ru/api --env AUTH_URI=https://oauth-client-test.geophystech.ru harbor.ju0.ru/geophystech/eqalert-front
```

## Vulnerabilities

  - node-sass@8.0.0 >> [website](https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2017-12964/?utm_source=jetbrains&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pycharm&utm_term=python)
  ```
    There is a stack consumption issue in all versions of LibSass,
    that is triggered in the function "Sass::Eval::operator()"
    in "eval.cpp". It will lead to a remote denial of service attack.
    This issue also affects all versions of other packages that use
    the LibSass library, such as node-sass, libsass-python, sassc, jsass.
  ```
